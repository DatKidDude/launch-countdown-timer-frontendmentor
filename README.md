## About The Project

In this challenge I will be building a responsive launch countdown timer with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Users should be able to:

1. View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size.
2. See hover states for all interactive elements on the page.
3. See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second.<br>
**Bonus:** When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle.

I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Google Fonts
- Font Awesome
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript
- Mobile-first workflow
- Date Object

## What I Learned

I learned a ton about how 3D CSS Animations work. The big takeaways are the CSS properties of perspective, preserve-3d, and backface visibility.
I also gained a deeper understanding of the positioning properties in CSS work. I was able to get more familiar with the Date object in Javascript and how to create factory functions to return an object. This project was way outside of my comfort zone and I really dove deep into understanding how CSS animations work.

## Useful Resources

Figma - Paste the design image inside of figma to check containers, width, etc...
